        <h1>Perihelion Privacy Policy</h1> 
        <h3>last updated: October 15th, 2024</h3>   
        <p>Perihelion does not store any personal information - however, it can store options & preferences as defined by you, as well as user generated content. <br />
            Some of this is automatically anonymized by its purpose - random text strings, for example. However, stuff like user settings and wikis aren't fully anonymized.<br />
            This data is not deleted automatically, since it's not personal information (and, you probably want to keep your preferences anyway)<br />
            This data is stored in the United States.<br />
            <br />
            This policy page may be changed at any time, however you are entitled to be informed through the "Rollplayer Central" discord server, in the "bot-announcements" channel.<br />
            If you want your information deleted, contact @whirlingstars on Discord.</p>

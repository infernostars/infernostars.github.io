        <h2>the 'answering' part</h2>
        <h4>Note that brackets [like these] indicate parts added/edited for the question to be grammatically correct.</h4>
        <h3>Which one do you like better: debugging or writing fresh code? <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>legi can probably attest but writing new code is way more enjoyable than working through techdebt for me lol</p>
        <h3>Just checking‚Äîis this <small>(perihelion)</small> like a real bot or one of those ‚Äúfun projects‚Äù you ghost after 2 week <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>it's the project I occasionally work on when I'm bored but it is mostly the fun projects i ghost after 2 week</p>
        <h3>Whirling, can you share any book or movie recommendations? Need that inspo. <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>these are less inspirational but all the books by Randall Munroe are pretty good since they're basically xkcd in book form lol</p>
        <h3>Real question: why ‚ÄúPerihelion‚Äù and not like‚Ä¶ I dunno, WhirlingBot3000? <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>originally it was called rollplayer, since it was based off legi's bot which... rolled dice. i added some more later but at some point it kinda ballooned. <br />
            i actually decided on naming it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirligig">whirligig</a> for some time, but legi and friends said it was a bad name [they are correct]. <br />
            we tried finding a new name for it and came up with perihelion, which stuck.
            the testing bots' names are all variations of that too (cheirohelion, katahelion, apohelion) <br /> <br />
            <h4>Update <small>(March 16th, 2025)</small></h4>
            i rerenamed it :D
        </p>
        <h3>will this bot ever become like, one of those creepy tracking apps? <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>that wouldn't be possible since discord only sends me info when you run a command anyway</p>
        <h3>hi i‚Äôm dumb, what‚Äôs the ‚ÄúDMCA‚Äù thing and is it just for fancy? <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>i basically only have it because it's a legal requirement</p>
        <h3>Are you planning to make an app or stay in the bot zone? <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>making bots is more fun than making uis so probably the latter</p>
        <h3>Asking for a friend‚Äîis any of this actually legal? üòÖ <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>no. i commit 7,200 transgender surgeries on illegal aliens each second</p>
        <h3>what do you think about AI taking over? Just sayin‚Äô <small>(November 1st, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p><img src="https://i.redd.it/tfm7n2sdy2ka1.png" alt="An OpenAI job listing for Killswitch Engineer. It's describing that they need someone to disable the AI if they 'turn on us'."/></p>

        <h3>why do you think your website should be "less good"? seems like an interesting philosophical stance on web design <small>(November 2nd, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>it's less good but also less of a pain to edit, net positive</p>
        <h3>Why did you choose Discord API over other platforms for bot development? The ecosystem seems quite saturated. <small>(November 2nd, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>it's saturated because it's really easy to make bots for it. the upside is that it's easy to make bots for it</p>

        <h3>Regarding the anonymization process mentioned in your privacy policy - could you elaborate on the technical implementation? <small>(November 2nd, 2024)</small></h3>
        <p>sure! as of now, I don't store your username or Discord ID or literally anything that could reverse it to you. <small>unless you mean settings, which can't be anonymized, because... then your settings wouldn't save...</small></p>
